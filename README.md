</div>

## ✨ Features

- **Token‑Efficient** – Only exposes relevant context via MCP tools, saving precious tokens
- **60+ Components** – Full coverage of DaisyUI’s component library
- **Auto‑Updatable** – Fetch the latest docs anytime with one command
- **Customizable** – Edit or add your own component docs to fit your project
- **Fast & Lightweight** – Built with [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) for optimal performance

## 🛠️ MCP Tools

This server exposes two tools that AI assistants can use:

- **`list_components`** – Lists all available DaisyUI components with short descriptions
- **`get_component`** – Gets full documentation for a specific component (classes, syntax, examples)

> 💡 The component docs are pulled from [daisyui.com/llms.txt](https://daisyui.com/llms.txt) and stored locally as markdown files. You can also add your own custom components or edit existing ones to match your project needs.

## 📦 Installation

> This method assumes you have already installed `uv`. If not, follow [these instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/birdseyevue/daisyui-mcp.git
cd daisyui-mcp
```

## 🚀 Usage

### First‑time setup

On first run, the MCP server will not have any component docs. Fetch them by running:

```bash
uv run update_components.py
```

This fetches the latest `llms.txt` from DaisyUI and generates all the markdown files in `/components`.

### Running the server

```bash
uv run mcp_server.py
```

### Updating component docs

If DaisyUI releases new components or updates their docs, simply run:

```bash
uv run update_components.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Add the MCP server to your AI assistant’s configuration.

## ❓ 1 most Frequently Asked Question

### Why are `update_components.py` and `mcp_server.py` separate scripts?

It may seem more efficient to combine them into a single script that automatically fetches docs on startup. However, keeping them separate provides important flexibility:

- **Preserving custom components** – If you add or modify component markdown files in `/components`, running `update_components.py` would overwrite them with the fresh upstream content. By separating the update step, you can decide when to pull the latest DaisyUI docs without losing your customizations.

- **Control over updates** – You might want to run the server with a known‑good set of docs, and only update when you explicitly choose to. This separation lets you keep the server running while you fetch updates independently.

> **If you don’t need custom components and prefer a one‑step launch**, you can create a simple wrapper script (`.bat`, `.sh`, or `.ps1`) that runs both commands sequentially, or modify the server to call the update function on startup. The current design prioritizes flexibility for users who want to keep their own modifications.

## ❗ Disclaimer

DaisyUI has an official [Blueprint MCP](https://daisyui.com/blueprint/) ($600 lifetime) with premium features.

This project is **not** that. It’s a free, DIY alternative **using their publicly available documentation**.
